            "bio": "<p>Dr. Rowe is a respected academic physician scientist – a pioneer in the field of personalized therapeutics for CF, cutting-edge discovery in airway disease biology, and translational research in COPD.  He is an international authority in the design and conduct of clinical trials targeting the basic CF defect, and has made key advances in the measurement and interpretation of CFTR function in humans and animals.  He has characterized that COPD patients with chronic bronchitis exhibit ‘acquired CFTR dysfunction’ through a pathway that causes delayed mucociliary clearance and confers chronic bronchitis. The approach establishes how a single gene in a rare disorder can contribute to the 3rd leading cause of death and has led to new efforts by his group to evaluate CFTR modulators in patients with chronic bronchitis, potentially leading to a new paradigm for COPD treatment.</p><p>Additionally, he is a Professor with tenure in the Departments of Medicine (Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine), Pediatrics (Pediatric Pulmonology), and Cell Developmental and Integrative Biology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). He is also the Director of the Gregory Fleming Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at UAB, which involves over 100 faculty members and has been continuously funded for over 25 years.</p>"

With a graduate degree in biostatistics, he focuses on novel statistical and mathematical methods for simulation of medical data, analysis of large healthcare datasets, and outcomes research. Dr. Segev was the first to demonstrate the survival benefit of incompatible kidney transplantation, the first to estimate attributable risk of ESRD in live kidney donors, and is responsible for the first HIV-to-HIV transplants in the United States. His NIH-funded research includes kidney exchange, desensitization, long-term donor risk, access to transplantation, expanding transplantation including HIV+ donors, geographic disparities, and the intersection between transplantation and gerontology. Dr. Segev received the American Society of Transplantation's Clinical Science Investigator Award. He is a councilor of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and former chair of the American Transplant Congress. His work has directly influenced policy, including two Congressional bills (the Norwood Act for kidney exchange and the HOPE Act for HIV-to-HIV transplants). Dr. Segev is most inspired by his role as a mentor, having mentored over 100 students, residents, and faculty, and is the only general surgeon in the US funded by an NIH/NIDDK Mentoring Grant.</p>"

Her laboratory has focused on B cell repertoire cloning from patients with the autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris to better understand how autoreactivity develops and to develop better targeted therapies for disease. Recently, her laboratory developed a novel genetically engineered cellular immunotherapy for autoimmune disease treatment known as chimeric autoantibody receptor T cell (CAART) therapy, which she is currently advancing toward clinical trials in pemphigus to assess its safety and curative potential.
