With a graduate degree in biostatistics, he focuses on novel statistical and mathematical methods for simulation of medical data, analysis of large healthcare datasets, and outcomes research. Dr. Segev was the first to demonstrate the survival benefit of incompatible kidney transplantation, the first to estimate attributable risk of ESRD in live kidney donors, and is responsible for the first HIV-to-HIV transplants in the United States. His NIH-funded research includes kidney exchange, desensitization, long-term donor risk, access to transplantation, expanding transplantation including HIV+ donors, geographic disparities, and the intersection between transplantation and gerontology. Dr. Segev received the American Society of Transplantation's Clinical Science Investigator Award. He is a councilor of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and former chair of the American Transplant Congress. His work has directly influenced policy, including two Congressional bills (the Norwood Act for kidney exchange and the HOPE Act for HIV-to-HIV transplants). Dr. Segev is most inspired by his role as a mentor, having mentored over 100 students, residents, and faculty, and is the only general surgeon in the US funded by an NIH/NIDDK Mentoring Grant.</p>"

Her laboratory has focused on B cell repertoire cloning from patients with the autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris to better understand how autoreactivity develops and to develop better targeted therapies for disease. Recently, her laboratory developed a novel genetically engineered cellular immunotherapy for autoimmune disease treatment known as chimeric autoantibody receptor T cell (CAART) therapy, which she is currently advancing toward clinical trials in pemphigus to assess its safety and curative potential.
